# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
*By* **Sahil Sartaj**
-------------------

### Overview
-------------
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”*Chicago, New York City, and Washington*. Using __Python__, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
